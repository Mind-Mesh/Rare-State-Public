## 🌟 What is RareState?

**RareState** is a mental health journaling and support platform designed for people who want more than mood logs. It helps users understand, process, and improve their emotional wellbeing with real-time insights and guided support.

We're blending psychology, design, and machine learning to help users:

* ✍️ Journal with purpose using smart prompts
* 📈 Track mood and discover behavioral patterns
* 🧠 Receive AI-driven insights and reflections
* 💬 Get nudges or coping tools when they need it most

> Think of RareState as a personal emotional toolkit — built with care, science, and soul.

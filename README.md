> Think of RareState as a personal emotional toolkit — built with care, science, and soul.

## 💡 What Inspired RareState?

RareState was born out of two truths:

1. We don’t always have someone to talk to.
2. Our emotional wellbeing often slips through the cracks.

As a developer with a background in civil engineering and a growing interest in mental health tech, I realized the journaling apps out there felt… passive. Pretty graphs, maybe a quote — but not much help when you’re overwhelmed at 11PM or spiraling before a big meeting.

I wanted to build something that responds. That *guides*, *reflects*, and *reminds you that you're not alone*. Something that doesn’t wait for you to seek help — but meets you where you are.

RareState is my response to that need. A tool I wish more people had — including me, at a few critical moments.
